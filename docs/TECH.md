# TECH — as built

Durable facts about what this repo actually does, moved here as features ship.
Design arguments stay in the feature docs; this is the state of the machine.

## Serving

`scripts/serve.sh <config>` starts `llama-server` from a config file and adds no
flags of its own. `make serve` runs it against `config/baseline.env`;
`make serve CONFIG=config/<variant>.env` runs a variant. Later features add a file
per variant rather than editing the baseline — that is what keeps 0003's ladder and
0004's grid mechanical instead of hand-run.

### Baseline, as measured 2026-08-17

| | |
|---|---|
| Model | `bartowski/Qwen3.8-27B-GGUF:Q4_K_M` |
| Resolved snapshot | `f0eec4a4bb4975114a030d048952d83c0a53c034` |
| Context | 32768 |
| KV cache | `q8_0` for K and V |
| Flash attention | `auto` |
| GPU layers | 999 (all) |
| Parallel slots | 1 |
| Chat template | `--jinja` (the model's own) |
| Load time | ~4.2 s, process cold and page cache warm |
| Resident memory | ~18.8 GB |

Load time is with the weights already in the OS page cache. A genuinely cold boot
reads ~17 GB off disk first and will be substantially slower.

Resident memory is measured at **low context occupancy** and is not a ceiling — KV
is not fully allocated until used. Finding the real envelope is
[0003](features/0003-establish-the-memory-and-context-ceiling.md).

### Model provenance

Weights live in llama.cpp's Hugging Face cache (`~/.cache/huggingface`), fetched by
`-hf`. The repo keeps no copy: llama.cpp already owns that cache and duplicating it
costs 17 GB for nothing.

`-hf` cannot pin a revision, so the snapshot hash above is the record. If upstream
re-uploads, `-hf` will resolve to something new and the recorded hash is what makes
that detectable. There is no automatic check for this.

## Dependencies

`llama.cpp` from Homebrew, build **10450**. It must support the `qwen35`
architecture, which is what `Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B` reports
(`Qwen3_5ForConditionalGeneration`).

**Re-check after every `brew upgrade`** — this is the dependency that breaks the
model silently rather than loudly:

```sh
strings /opt/homebrew/lib/libllama.dylib | grep -c '^qwen35$'   # expect 1
```

That build also serves the **Anthropic Messages API** at `/v1/messages` and
`/v1/messages/count_tokens`, converting to chat-completions internally. Claude Code
can therefore point at this server with `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` and no proxy — see
[0008](features/0008-wire-the-winning-config-into-the-coding-agent.md).

## Checks

`make check` is the offline gate and is what CI runs: `gofmt` cleanliness, `go vet`,
and `go test -race`. It needs no server and no model weights, because CI has neither.

`make smoke` runs `scripts/smoke.sh` against a *running* endpoint: health, a chat
completion that must return non-empty content, and a tool call that must return valid
JSON containing the schema's required field. It disables thinking for speed and
determinism — whether thinking helps is
[0005](features/0005-tune-sampling-and-tool-call-adherence.md)'s axis, not a gate's.

`make verify` is both, and is the gate to run before shipping anything that touches
serving. The split exists because the two answer different questions: `check` asks
whether the code holds, `smoke` asks whether this machine is actually serving.

## The measured envelope

Everything in this section is observed, not derived. It is scoped to **Qwen3.8-27B at
Q4_K_M, contexts 8k–64k, on a 32 GB M2 Max**, and re-measuring is required before any of
it is quoted for another model, quant, context or machine.

### Context costs time, not memory — in this envelope

| ctx | KV | peak RSS | cold ingest | prompt tok/s | swap Δ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8 192 | q8_0 | 17.91 GB | 68 s | 109.4 | 0.0 MB |
| 16 384 | q8_0 | 18.64 GB | 149 s | 99.7 | 0.0 MB |
| 16 384 | f16 | 19.07 GB | 139 s | 106.1 | 0.0 MB |
| 32 768 | q4_0 | 18.66 GB | 325 s | 91.0 | 0.0 MB |
| 32 768 | q8_0 | 19.13 GB | 326 s | 90.7 | 0.0 MB |
| 49 152 | q8_0 | 19.72 GB | 543 s | 81.5 | 0.0 MB |
| 65 536 | q8_0 | 20.27 GB | 788 s | 75.0 | 0.0 MB |

Nothing swapped at any rung, so **no memory ceiling exists in this envelope**. What grows
is ingest: the prompt rate decays with depth, making a cold 32k context cost 5.4 minutes
and a cold 64k cost 13.1.

**This does not mean memory never binds.** Only one quant was tested. Q6_K weights are
roughly 6 GB heavier, and larger models and longer contexts are untested. 0004's quant
sweep is where memory gets its next real chance.

Marginal KV cost measures **31–37 KB/token** above the first rung, against ~139 KB/token
derived from the config. Some KV allocation is evidently not attributed to process RSS on
Apple Silicon; treat RSS as a lower bound.

### Other measured costs

| | |
|---|---|
| Multimodal projector | **1.02 GB** — 18.26 GB with, 17.23 GB without (`--no-mmproj`) |
| Model load | 4.2 s with a warm page cache; a cold boot reads ~17 GB off disk first |
| Prompt cache reuse | 11 552 of 12 068 tokens reused; a repeated request fell 7.0 s → 2.6 s |
| Smoke gate | 6.5 s |
| Thinking mode | 3.06× completion tokens, 1.67× wall, on tier-1 tasks |

### Ladder rungs are derived, not written down

`scripts/rungs.sh` computes which contexts to ladder over from the machine: total memory,
the weights file's actual size, a reserve for the desktop, the measured KB/token, and an
ingest-time budget. It reports **which of memory or time binds**, which is the ladder's
whole question.

On this machine it derives 8k/16k/32k/64k — the same rungs that were first written by
hand — and reports ingest time as the binding constraint. Modelling 128 GB with
`TOTAL_GB=128` gives **the same rungs**, and so does a 70 GB model: memory allows ~262k
tokens in every case while a 20-minute ingest budget allows ~64k.

That is worth stating plainly: **more RAM does not buy more context for this model.** It
buys larger quants and larger models. Context is bounded by ingest time, and ingest time
does not care how much memory is spare.

## Gotchas

Each of these has already caused a wrong number in this repo.

- **Free memory is not a pressure signal on macOS.** It sits at 0.01–0.02 GB whether the
  machine is idle with zero swap or deep in paging. Use swap used, swap delta and
  compressor size. An entire "the config does not fit" argument was built on free memory
  and was wrong.
- **`ps rss` is clamped by what physically fits, not by what a process wants.** Under
  pressure it stops distinguishing configs exactly where the answer matters — peak RSS
  moved 0.82 GB across a fourfold context range while saturated, and more once pressure
  was gone. Time-to-ingest discriminates where RSS does not.
- **Killing an 18 GB server is not instant.** A fixed `sleep` after `pkill` lets the next
  server fail to bind while the health check passes against the *old* one, silently
  measuring the previous config under the next config's name. Poll until the process is
  gone, then verify `/props` reports the context you asked for.
- **A shared `max_tokens` starves thinking mode.** Reasoning is charged against the same
  budget as the answer, so a cap sized while testing with thinking off produces empty
  answers and looks like a quality failure. Detect `finish_reason == "length"` separately;
  never score a truncated answer as a wrong one.
- **`-hf` downloads more than the weights.** It pulls and loads an 888 MB multimodal
  projector when the repo ships one, costing 1.02 GB resident that text-only coding never
  uses.
- **The HuggingFace cache stores snapshots as symlinks into `blobs/`.** BSD `stat -f%z`
  does not follow them and reports the link's own size, which reads as a 0 GB model and
  silently inflates any headroom estimate built on it. Use `stat -L -f%z`.
- **zsh does not word-split unquoted variables.** Scripts here run under `bash` via
  shebang; a loop written interactively in zsh can produce config filenames with the value
  glued in, which the ladder will then glob and parse.
